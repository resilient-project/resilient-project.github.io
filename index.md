# Resilient Energy System Infrastructure Layouts for Industry, E-Fuels and Network Transitions

## About

The energy transition faces many uncertainties, but planning tools are often deterministic. Our
proposal will develop the first truly multi-vector energy infrastructure planning tool that represents
this uncertain environment, both at a regional and national as well as the European level. We will
build on the existing widely-used, open-source, sector-coupled energy planning tool for Europe,
PyPSA-Eur, and add stochastic optimisation capabilities as well as a deeper representation of
industry transformation, e-fuel conversion, biomass and carbon capture infrastructure. We will look
at uncertainties that include the cost of fuels and technologies, hydrogen availability, network
expansion delays for electricity, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, value chain restructuring in industry,
imports of e-fuels and secondary materials, renewables build-out and social acceptance. We will
examine novel computational techniques to address stochastic problems in a performant way. For
this proposal, we have assembled a team of leading academic researchers and need-owners from
industry who are at the cutting edge of energy system modelling. We will demonstrate the
capabilities of our planning tool in several case studies for resilient infrastructure planning, together
with our need-owners in France, Germany, Sweden and Finland. We plan several workshops and
training events with a broader circle of need owners and stakeholders to ensure a wide uptake of our
innovative project results.

- At the [Technical University of Berlin (TUB)](https://tu.berlin), the department of Digital Transformation in Energy Systems
is the lead developer of the open energy system modelling framework PyPSA and the high-resolution
model PyPSA-Eur of the European sector-coupled energy system. The group leverages
cutting-edge research from a variety of disciplines to understand the most cost-effective pathways to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the energy system. The department will lead the project overall, as
well as the integration of new modelling features and the training of need-owners.

- The team at [University of Pisa (UNIPI)](https://www.unipi.it/) is the core developer of Structured Modelling System
(SMS++), an open-source modelling framework that supports advanced decomposition techniques to
break down computational requirements for large-scale stochastic optimization problems. It will be a key
partner to integrate SMS++ as an backend of PyPSA, needed to enhance its computational capabilities.

long-term energy demand from sectors including industry, and the impact of variable renewable energies
in the power system. At Fraunhofer ISI one of the leading industry transformation models,
FORECAST, which has been used in several German and European projects, will be integrated into
PyPSA-Eur to model fuel and process switching in each industrial sector.
